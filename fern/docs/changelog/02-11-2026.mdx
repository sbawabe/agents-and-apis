## New features

### Real-time plant events via WebSocket
The Plant Store API now supports real-time event streaming! Connect to our new WebSocket endpoint at `wss://ws.plantstore.dev/ws/plants` to receive live notifications when plants are created, updated, or change status. Subscribe to specific event types or filter by plant ID.

### Quickstart guide
Added a brand-new quickstart guide to help developers go from zero to their first plant in under 5 minutes. Includes code examples in cURL, Python, and TypeScript.

## Improvements

- Improved search performance for the `/plant/search/tags` endpoint when filtering by multiple tags
- API responses now include `X-Request-Id` headers for easier debugging
