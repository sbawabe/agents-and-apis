Before you start building with the Plant Store API, let's make sure you actually know your plants. Here are some of the most persistent houseplant myths — debunked.

---

## Myth #1: Talking to your plants helps them grow

<Accordion title="Verdict: Surprisingly... kind of true?">
Plants don't understand your words (sorry), but the CO2 you exhale while chatting with them *does* help with photosynthesis. Studies from the Royal Horticultural Society found that plants exposed to human voices grew faster — and that plants responded slightly better to female voices. So go ahead, tell your fern about your day.

## Myth #2: Cacti don't need any water

<Accordion title="Verdict: False">
Cacti are drought-tolerant, not drought-proof. In the wild, they survive long dry spells, but they still need regular watering during their growing season (spring and summer). A good rule of thumb: water when the top inch of soil is completely dry. Overwatering is the #1 killer of cacti — but underwatering is #2.
</Accordion>

## Myth #3: Yellow leaves always mean overwatering

<Accordion title="Verdict: It's complicated">
Yellow leaves are the plant equivalent of "something is wrong" — but the cause could be anything:

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|-------------|
| Yellow + mushy stems | Overwatering |
| Yellow + dry, crispy edges | Underwatering |
| Yellow + dropping lower leaves | Low light |
| Yellow + tiny white dots | Spider mites |
| Yellow + it's winter | Seasonal dormancy |

Check the soil moisture before reaching for the watering can.

## Myth #4: All plants purify your air

<Accordion title="Verdict: Technically true, practically useless">
The famous 1989 NASA study found that plants like pothos and peace lilies remove toxins from air. What they don't mention: the study was conducted in sealed chambers. To get meaningful air purification in a real room, you'd need roughly **700 plants per 1,500 sq ft** apartment. At that point, you don't have a home — you have a greenhouse.
</Accordion>

## Myth #5: You should water on a fixed schedule

<Accordion title="Verdict: False">
"Water every Sunday" sounds organized, but plants don't follow your calendar. Water needs change with:

- **Season** — plants drink more in summer
- **Humidity** — dry apartments need more frequent watering
- **Pot size** — small pots dry out faster
- **Soil type** — peat retains water, perlite drains fast

The best schedule? Stick your finger in the soil. If it's dry an inch down, water. If it's moist, wait.
</Accordion>

## Myth #6: Putting rocks at the bottom of a pot improves drainage

<Accordion title="Verdict: False — it actually makes drainage worse">
This one surprises everyone. Adding a gravel layer creates a "perched water table" — a zone where water pools at the boundary between soil and rocks due to differences in particle size. The water has nowhere to go until the soil above is fully saturated. Your plant ends up sitting in more moisture, not less. Just use a pot with a drainage hole and good potting mix.

## The real takeaway

Plants are weird, resilient, and full of surprises — kind of like APIs. Now that you're armed with actual plant knowledge, go explore the [Plant Store API](/api-reference) and build something cool.
