title: The Best Pizza in NYC
subtitle: A deeply opinionated, thoroughly researched, and entirely correct guide to New York City's finest slices.
---

There are certain truths in this world that transcend debate. The earth orbits the sun. Water is wet. And New York City has the best pizza on the planet.

This is not a matter of opinion. It is a matter of geology, chemistry, history, and destiny. The confluence of New York's mineral-rich tap water, its century-old sourdough cultures, its coal-fired and deck ovens, and the sheer competitive pressure of ten thousand pizzerias crammed into five boroughs has produced something that no other city can replicate. Many have tried. All have failed.

What follows is a guide to the very best of the best.

## The Legends

### Di Fara Pizza — Midwood, Brooklyn

For decades, Dom DeMarco stood behind his counter at Di Fara, hand-slicing fresh basil with scissors onto every single pie, drizzling olive oil he imported himself from Italy, and producing what many consider the single greatest slice of pizza ever made. The crust chars in exactly the right places. The cheese pulls in long, golden strands. The sauce tastes like someone distilled an entire Italian summer into a ladle.

Di Fara is not fast. Di Fara is not cheap. Di Fara does not care about your schedule. You will wait in line, and you will be grateful for the privilege.

<Note>
Dom DeMarco passed away in March 2022, but the family continues to run the shop using his recipes and techniques. The spirit endures.

### Joe's Pizza — Greenwich Village, Manhattan

Joe's is the Platonic ideal of a New York slice. Thin, foldable, with a perfect ratio of sauce to cheese to crust. It is the slice you picture when someone says "New York pizza." It is the slice that has fueled late-night stumbles down Carmine Street for generations.

Joe's does not need to be fancy. Joe's does not need wood-fired anything. Joe's just needs to be exactly what it is: perfect.

### Lucali — Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn

Mark Iacono's Lucali is a different animal entirely. This is whole-pie territory. You will wait two hours. You will bring your own wine. And when that pie arrives at your table — impossibly thin, bubbling with fresh mozzarella, the crust somehow both crispy and pillowy — you will understand why people do this to themselves on a Tuesday night.

Lucali does not serve slices. Lucali does not take reservations. Lucali is a test of devotion, and the devout are rewarded.

## The Dollar Slice

Let us pause to honor the dollar slice.

The dollar slice is not trying to win awards. The dollar slice is not sourcing high-end buffalo mozzarella. The dollar slice exists for one reason: to provide a hot, cheesy, satisfying meal to anyone with a crumpled bill in their pocket.

And you know what? A great dollar slice — from 2 Bros, from 99 Cent Fresh Pizza, from any of the dozens of neon-lit storefronts scattered across Midtown — is a beautiful thing. It is democracy on a paper plate. It is the great equalizer. A hedge fund manager and a bike messenger standing side by side at a counter, folding their slices in exactly the same way, getting the same orange grease on their fingers.

Never let anyone tell you the dollar slice doesn't count.

<Warning>
If your dollar slice costs more than $1.50, the social contract has been violated. Report the establishment to the appropriate authorities (your group chat).

## The New Guard

### Scarr's Pizza — Lower East Side, Manhattan

Scarr Pimentel mills his own grain. Let that sink in. The man is milling flour in the back of a pizza shop on Orchard Street, and the result is a slice with a nuttier, more complex flavor than anything you've had before. The crust has character. It has opinions. It has a backstory.

Scarr's proves that the classic New York slice is not a museum piece. It is a living, evolving art form.

### L'industrie Pizzeria — Williamsburg, Brooklyn

L'industrie walks the line between a classic slice joint and something more ambitious. The burrata slice — a regular slice topped with an entire ball of burrata and some fresh basil — is an act of beautiful excess. It should not work. It works magnificently.

### Prince Street Pizza — Nolita, Manhattan

The pepperoni square at Prince Street Pizza is the single most photogenic slice in New York City. The small, crispy pepperoni cups pool with rendered fat, the cheese caramelizes at the edges, and the thick Sicilian-style crust provides a sturdy foundation for the chaos above.

You will see this slice on Instagram. You will want this slice. You will wait in line for this slice. You will not regret it.

## The Coal-Fired Originals

### Lombardi's — Nolita, Manhattan

Lombardi's claims to be America's first pizzeria, established in 1905. Whether or not the historical record fully supports this (it's complicated), the pizza itself is undeniably excellent. The coal-fired oven produces a char and smokiness that gas ovens simply cannot match.

### Totonno's — Coney Island, Brooklyn

Totonno's has been open since 1924 and operates with the kind of casual indifference to customer service that only a century of excellence can earn. The pizza is transcendent. The hours are unpredictable. They will run out of dough and close early, and you will just have to deal with it.

<Note>
Totonno's accepts cash only. This is not an inconvenience. This is an atmosphere choice.

### Patsy's — East Harlem, Manhattan

The original Patsy's in East Harlem (not the unrelated chain locations) serves a coal-oven pie that is among the city's finest. The thin, charred crust, the tangy sauce, the fresh mozzarella — it is a masterclass in simplicity.

## The Great Debates

### Thin Crust vs. Sicilian

This is a false dichotomy. A great city contains multitudes. You can love the crisp fold of a thin slice and also love the pillowy, olive-oil-soaked depth of a Sicilian square. Choosing between them is like choosing between jazz and rock and roll. The correct answer is both.

### Fold or No Fold

You fold. This is not negotiable. The fold is structural engineering. The fold channels the grease. The fold allows you to eat while walking, which is the natural state of pizza consumption in New York City. If you eat a New York slice with a knife and fork, you are technically committing a misdemeanor.

### Is New York Pizza Better Than Chicago Deep Dish?

Chicago deep dish is a casserole. It is a fine casserole. But it is not pizza. This concludes the discussion.

## A Note on Water

Every few years, someone writes an article claiming that New York's tap water is the secret to its pizza dough. The theory goes that the specific mineral content of NYC water — drawn from upstate reservoirs in the Catskill Mountains — creates a dough texture that cannot be reproduced elsewhere.

Is this true? The science is... inconclusive. But it *feels* true, and in the world of pizza, feeling is everything. New York water is soft, low in calcium and magnesium, and it produces a dough that is supple, extensible, and forgiving. Could you replicate it with filtered water and mineral adjustments? Maybe. But then you wouldn't be in New York, and that's really the point.

## The Rules

<Steps>
### Always fold your slice
The structural integrity of the experience depends on it.

### Eat it hot
A New York slice has a half-life of about four minutes. After that, you're just eating bread with cold cheese.

### Don't be afraid of the corner slice
The corner of a Sicilian square is the most underrated piece of pizza in the city. Extra crust, extra crisp, extra everything.

### Respect the pizza maker
The person behind the counter has been doing this since before you were born. Don't ask for modifications. Don't ask if the dough is gluten-free. Just order and say thank you.

### Explore beyond Manhattan
Some of the best pizza in the city is in the outer boroughs. Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island — they all have gems. Get on the subway.
</Steps>

## Final Word

New York pizza is not just food. It is infrastructure. It is cultural identity. It is the thing that holds this ridiculous, beautiful, impossible city together at 2 AM when the subways are running on weekend schedules and nothing else is open.

Every New Yorker has their spot. Their slice. Their place where the guy behind the counter knows their order. This is not sentimentality. This is survival.

Go eat some pizza.
