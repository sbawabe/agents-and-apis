## Pizza Poems

### Ode to a Perfect Slice

A triangle of gold held high,
Cheese stretching long beneath the sky,
The crust a ring of golden bread,
With sauce like sunset, ruby red.

One bite and all the world goes still,
A warmth that no cold night can chill,
From Brooklyn corners, Roman streets,
No other food so truly treats.

### Midnight Pizza

The box arrives at half past one,
The day is done, the battle won,
I crack the lid — a cloud of steam,
This greasy treasure, heaven's dream.

Pepperoni curling at the edge,
A salty, spicy, sacred pledge,
That nothing else at midnight hour
Could match this cheesy, saucy power.

### The Margherita Speaks

I am the simplest of them all,
Three colors standing proud and tall,
Tomato, mozzarella, green —
The finest flag you've ever seen.

No toppings piled in gaudy heaps,
Just flavor deep that gently seeps,
A whisper where the others shout,
That's what good pizza is about.

### Cold Pizza Morning

Some say it's wrong, a breakfast crime,
But cold pizza transcends all time,
The cheese grown firm, the crust more stiff,
Each frigid bite a morning riff.

No microwave, no oven heat,
Just standing barefoot, half asleep,
The fridge light on, the kitchen dark —
Cold pizza lights a tiny spark.

### Deep Dish Reverie

Chicago, city big and bold,
You bake your pies like pots of gold,
A casserole of molten cheese,
Enough to bring me to my knees.

The sauce on top — a rebel's way,
A thick and heavy, glorious tray,
You need a fork, you need a knife,
Deep dish, you are the stuff of life.

## Slimy Packaged Hot Dog Poems

### The Package

Sealed in plastic, soft and cold,
A cylinder of mystery sold,
It sits beneath fluorescent light
On shelves that hum throughout the night.

You peel the wrapper — there it gleams,
A tube of processed, salty dreams,
A brine so thick it coats your hand,
A texture few can understand.

### Ode to the Slime

Oh viscous coat of pinkish sheen,
The slimiest thing I've ever seen,
You cling to fingers, cling to plate,
A gel of undetermined fate.

What are you made of? No one knows,
Some broth, some salt, some juice that flows
From meats unnamed and spices ground
Into a paste both lost and found.

### Midnight Dogs

At 2 a.m. the hunger calls,
I shuffle down the darkened halls,
The fridge door opens with a sigh —
There sits the pack, it catches my eye.

I grab a dog straight from the sleeve,
No bun, no mustard — just reprieve,
It wobbles, jiggles in my grip,
A cold and gelatinous trip.

### The Hot Dog Reflects

I was not always what I am,
This pale and quivering tube of ham,
Once I had dreams of finer things —
Of butcher shops and apron strings.

But now I float in salty brine,
In plastic tombs where I recline,
A humble frank in cellophane,
A soggy soldier, free of pain.

### Ballad of the Grocery Aisle

Past the bread and past the cheese,
Past the honey and the peas,
There's a section, cold and wide,
Where the packaged hot dogs hide.

Stacked in rows of eight or ten,
Waiting to be bought again,
Glistening beneath the wrap,
Resting in their slimy nap.

### Haiku Trio

*Plastic peeled away —*
*a glistening frank revealed,*
*wobbling in the light.*

*Brine drips on the plate,*
*the hot dog does not protest —*
*it has accepted.*

*Mustard cannot hide*
*the existential sadness*
*of a packaged frank.*
