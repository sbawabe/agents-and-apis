Ferns are vascular plants that reproduce via spores rather than seeds. With over 10,000 known species, they thrive in a wide range of environments, from tropical rainforests to temperate woodlands.

## Key characteristics

- **Fronds**: Fern leaves, called fronds, typically unfurl from a tightly coiled structure known as a fiddlehead.
- **Spore reproduction**: Instead of producing flowers or seeds, ferns release spores from structures called sporangia, usually found on the undersides of fronds.
- **Vascular system**: Unlike mosses, ferns have a vascular system for transporting water and nutrients, which allows them to grow larger.

## Common varieties

| Variety | Light | Humidity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Boston fern | Indirect | High | Popular hanging basket plant |
| Maidenhair fern | Low to indirect | High | Delicate, fan-shaped fronds |
| Staghorn fern | Bright, indirect | Moderate | Grows mounted on boards |
| Bird's nest fern | Low to indirect | Moderate | Broad, wavy fronds |

## Quick care tips

1. Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.
2. Provide indirect light; most ferns scorch in direct sun.
3. Mist regularly or place near a humidifier to maintain humidity.

<Note>
Ferns have existed for over 350 million years, predating both flowering plants and dinosaurs.
