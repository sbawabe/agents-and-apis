title: Hot Dog Sliminess Rankings
subtitle: A definitive ranking of packaged hot dog brands by their sliminess factor.

We opened the packages so you don't have to. Every brand was evaluated fresh out of the pack on a scale from 1 (practically dry) to 10 (you could use it as a slip-n-slide).

## The Rankings

### 1. Bar-S — Sliminess: 10/10

Bar-S franks emerge from the package coated in a viscous, almost sentient gel. The moment you tear the vacuum seal you are met with a slick, glistening log that practically leaps out of your hand. Undisputed champion of slime.

### 2. Gwaltney — Sliminess: 9/10

Gwaltney dogs sit in a translucent brine that clings to every surface. Picking one up bare-handed is an exercise in futility. Budget-friendly *and* budget-slimy.

### 3. Oscar Mayer Classic Wieners — Sliminess: 7/10

The classic yellow package delivers a reliably slimy experience. A generous film of mystery liquid coats each dog, requiring at least one paper-towel wipe before handling.

### 4. Ball Park Franks — Sliminess: 6/10

Ball Park lands squarely in the middle. There is a noticeable slick on the surface, but it is more of a light sheen than a full-on coating. Manageable, but still slippery.

### 5. Nathan's Famous — Sliminess: 5/10

Nathan's dogs have a slight tackiness that borders on slime but never fully commits. You can pick one up without it shooting across the kitchen counter — most of the time.

### 6. Hebrew National — Sliminess: 4/10

Hebrew National's all-beef dogs have a drier casing that resists the slime. A thin moisture layer is present, but it evaporates quickly once exposed to air.

### 7. Applegate Naturals — Sliminess: 3/10

Applegate keeps things clean. The dogs are lightly moist but never slimy. The lack of fillers and artificial ingredients seems to correlate with a lack of goo.

### 8. Boar's Head — Sliminess: 2/10

Boar's Head dogs are almost surprisingly dry for a packaged frank. A faint dampness is all you will find — no slime trail left behind on the plate.

### 9. Dietz & Watson — Sliminess: 1/10

The driest dog on the list. Dietz & Watson franks feel nearly matte to the touch. If you are slime-averse, this is your brand.

## Methodology

Each brand was purchased from a standard grocery store, refrigerated at the same temperature, and opened on camera. Sliminess was assessed by three independent judges using the following criteria:

| Criterion | Weight |
|---|---|
| Initial liquid volume in package | 30% |
| Surface film thickness on the dog | 30% |
| Grip difficulty (bare-hand pickup test) | 20% |
| Residue left on plate after 10 seconds | 20% |

Scores were averaged across judges and rounded to the nearest whole number.

<Note>
This ranking is based on standard, refrigerated, pre-cooked hot dog varieties from each brand. Specialty lines (e.g., cheese-filled, jumbo, or uncured) may vary in sliminess.
