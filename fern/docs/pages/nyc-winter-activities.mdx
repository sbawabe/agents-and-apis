New York City transforms into a winter wonderland when the cold season hits. From iconic ice skating rinks to cozy cultural experiences, here are the top 10 activities to enjoy in NYC during the winter months.

## 1. Ice Skating at Rockefeller Center

No winter in NYC is complete without a spin around The Rink at Rockefeller Center. Glide beneath the towering Christmas tree (through early January) and the golden Prometheus statue for one of the most iconic urban skating experiences in the world. Sessions run from late October through April, and booking in advance is recommended to skip the lines.

## 2. Explore the Metropolitan Museum of Art

Escape the cold and lose yourself in one of the world's greatest art collections. The Met houses over two million works spanning 5,000 years of history. Spend an afternoon wandering from the Egyptian Temple of Dendur to the European Paintings galleries. Winter weekdays are ideal for smaller crowds.

## 3. Walk Through Central Park in the Snow

Central Park takes on a magical quality after a fresh snowfall. Bundle up and stroll along the Mall, cross Bow Bridge, or take in the view from Belvedere Castle draped in white. The Wollman Rink inside the park is another great spot for ice skating with skyline views.

## 4. Catch a Broadway Show

Winter is prime Broadway season. Warm up in a historic theater and enjoy world-class performances ranging from long-running classics like *The Lion King* to the latest award-winning productions. Matinee shows are a perfect way to spend a chilly afternoon.

## 5. Visit the Holiday Markets

NYC's holiday markets run well into January. The Union Square Holiday Market and the Winter Village at Bryant Park feature hundreds of vendors selling handmade gifts, artisanal foods, and warm drinks. Bryant Park's market also surrounds a free-admission ice skating rink.

## 6. Warm Up in a Classic NYC Coffee Shop or Bakery

Ducking into a cozy cafe is a quintessential winter activity. Head to iconic spots like Russ & Daughters Cafe on the Lower East Side, Abraco in the East Village, or Levain Bakery for their famous oversized cookies. Hot chocolate from City Bakery (known for their thick, rich recipe) is a winter must.

## 7. See the City Lights from Top of the Rock or The Edge

Winter's early sunsets mean stunning golden-hour skyline views in the late afternoon. The observation deck at Top of the Rock offers unobstructed views of the Empire State Building and Central Park, while The Edge at Hudson Yards provides a thrilling open-air sky deck experience 100 stories up.

## 8. Explore the American Museum of Natural History

Another world-class museum perfect for a cold day. Wander through the dinosaur halls, visit the Hayden Planetarium, and explore the butterfly conservatory (a warm, tropical escape in the dead of winter). The museum's annual Origami Holiday Tree is a unique seasonal highlight.

## 9. Eat Your Way Through Chelsea Market

Chelsea Market is an indoor food hall and shopping destination housed in a former Nabisco factory. Sample fresh lobster rolls, tacos, artisan doughnuts, ramen, and more from dozens of vendors. It's the perfect place to spend a couple of hours eating and exploring while staying warm.

## 10. Take in a Jazz Show in Greenwich Village

End a winter evening with live jazz at one of the Village's legendary clubs. The Village Vanguard, Blue Note, and Smalls Jazz Club have hosted the greatest names in jazz for decades. Grab a seat, order a drink, and enjoy an intimate performance as the cold night passes outside.
