Fern transforms your API definition into production-ready SDKs, documentation, and server boilerplate so you can focus on building your product instead of maintaining infrastructure.

## One source of truth, many outputs

Define your API once using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, gRPC, or Fern Definition. Fern generates idiomatic client libraries for 10+ languages, interactive documentation, and server stubs from that single source.

```yaml title="generators.yml"
groups:
  python-sdk:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-python-sdk
        output:
          location: pypi
          package-name: plantstore
  typescript-sdk:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-typescript-sdk
        output:
          location: npm
          package-name: "@plantstore/sdk"
```

## SDKs that feel handwritten

Fern-generated SDKs follow each language's conventions. They include type-safe models, async support, pagination helpers, and retry logic out of the box. Your users get a `POST /plants/{plantId}` endpoint wrapped in a method like:

```python
client.plants.update(
    plant_id="plant_001",
    name="Monstera Deliciosa",
    watering_schedule="weekly"
)
```

No HTTP boilerplate. No manual serialization. Just clean, idiomatic code.

## Docs that stay in sync

Fern Docs generates a full documentation site directly from your API spec. API references, code examples, and changelogs update automatically when your spec changes. The result is a polished site with:

- Interactive API explorer with authentication flows
- Auto-generated code examples in every SDK language
- Built-in search and AI-powered chat
- LLM-optimized endpoints (`/llms.txt`) for AI coding assistants

## Autorelease handles the busywork

When your API spec changes, Fern Autorelease detects the diff, determines the right version bump, regenerates your SDKs, and publishes them to package registries. No manual releases. No version drift.

## Built for teams
